# The SRE Manifesto

We, the `Becoming an SRE Rockstar` authors and technical reviewers, met together to discover better ways of defining who is the site reliability engineer (SRE) persona.

We believe we can create a more unified, concise, and solid SRE persona by stating their essential responsibilities:

* SREs make sure their `applications` are `reliable` and not just available and resilient.

* SREs guarantee all systems and applications are `observable` and under `monitoring`.

* SREs manage systems, services, and Infrastructure to learn how to `automate toil`.

* SREs use `data science` and apply `statistical methods` to understand observability data.

We welcome anyone to use this **manifesto** at will as we made it public. We will review this **manifesto** and update it in this repository every year.

`August 22, 2022`.

Signing,

* `Jeremy Proffitt` - Book author, SRE Director, Ally
* `Rod Anami` - Book author, Client Transformation SRE, Kyndryl
* `Gene Brown` - Book tech reviewer, Distinguished Engineer, Kyndryl
