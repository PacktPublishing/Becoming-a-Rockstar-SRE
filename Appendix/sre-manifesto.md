# SRE Manifesto

We the `Becoming an SRE Rockstar` authors and technical reviewers, met together to discover better ways of defining who is the site reliability engineer (SRE) persona.

We believe we can create a more unified, concise, and solid SRE persona by stating their essential responsibilities:

* SREs make sure their customer's applications are `reliable`

* 

We welcome any one to use this **manifesto** at will as we made it public. We will review this **manifesto** and update it in this repository every year.

`August 22, 2022`.

Signing,

* `Jeremy Proffitt` - SRE Director - Ally
* `Rod Anami` - Client Transformation SRE - Kyndryl
