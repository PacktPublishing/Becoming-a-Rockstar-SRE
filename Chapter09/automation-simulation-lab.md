# Becoming a Rockstar SRE

## Chapter 9 - Automation Simulation Lab

### Learning objectives

* Learn about `software bill of materials` (SBOM) for containers

* Learn how to automate `application build` process

### Pre-requisite knowledge

* Familiarity with JavaScript and Node.js

* Basic understanding of containers and `Docker`

### Docker

The first lab part utilizes **Docker Desktop** and the **Docker Hub** for container images registry. You can create a free account on Docker Hub through this [link](https://hub.docker.com/signup). You can download and install the Docker Desktop which includes `docker` CLI by checking this [document](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

### Contents

| app-build.sh | `Automation script to build a containerized app and attach a SBOM to it` |
| Dockerfile | `A Docker document with all commands and instructions to assemble a container image` |
| package.json | `Node.js project metadata file that contains packages used by the application` |
| sbom.spdx.json | `Software Bill of Materials generated by syft tool` |
| server.js | `Node.js simple API application used in this lab` |

### Installation

* SBOM

1. To install `syft` CLI, follow the details from [here](https://github.com/anchore/syft#installation)

2. To install `grype` CLI, use the instructions at this [link](https://github.com/anchore/grype#installation)

### Configuration

* SBOM

1. Change the enviromental variables accordingly inside `app-build.sh`

```shell
export VERSION="0.1.3"
export USERNAME="rod4n4m1"
export APPNAME="node-api"
export PASSWORD="xxxxxxxx"
```

2. Replace `username` and `password` for the respective values from the Docker account that you created

### Usage
